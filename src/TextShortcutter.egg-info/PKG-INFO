# TextShortcutter

Text shortcut app. Everything TextExpander wishes it was. Better shortcuts, better templates, better SECURITY!

## Security Features

TextShortcutter implements a comprehensive security architecture to address keylogger concerns:

### 🔒 **Minimal Data Retention**
- **No persistent logging**: Input is processed and immediately cleared from memory
- **Secure memory management**: Sensitive data is zeroed out after use
- **Automatic cleanup**: Memory is cleared on application exit and periodically during runtime

### 👁️ **User Control & Transparency**
- **Real-time feedback**: Users see what's being captured before expansion
- **Application filtering**: Users can specify safe/blocked applications
- **Trigger key system**: Expansion only activates with explicit user action
- **Audit logging**: All expansions are logged with timestamps for user review

### 🛡️ **Encrypted Storage**
- **AES-256 encryption**: All expansion pairs stored encrypted
- **Platform-specific keys**: Uses OS keychain/credential storage
- **Secure key management**: Encryption keys protected by platform security

### 🔐 **Data Protection**
- **Secure storage**: Encrypted configuration files
- **Memory protection**: Secure memory allocation and cleanup
- **Backup security**: Encrypted backup files with integrity checking
- **Permission control**: Proper file permissions on all sensitive files

### 📊 **Monitoring & Auditing**
- **Security monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity
- **Audit trails**: Complete logging of all security events
- **Performance monitoring**: Tracks system performance impact
- **Integrity checking**: Regular system integrity verification

## Quick Start

1. **Download and Install**: Get the latest release for your platform
2. **Configure Security Level**: Set appropriate security level (1-10) in settings
3. **Add Expansions**: Use the GUI to add your text expansions
4. **Set Safe Applications**: Configure which applications are safe for expansion
5. **Start Using**: Use your configured trigger key to activate expansions

## Security Levels

- **Level 1-3**: Basic security, minimal restrictions
- **Level 4-6**: Standard security with common protections
- **Level 7-10**: High security with maximum restrictions

## Privacy Mode

Enable privacy mode for enhanced security:
- Stricter application and field filtering
- Reduced logging
- Additional input validation

## Emergency Features

- **Emergency lock**: Instantly locks application
- **Data wipe**: Securely erases all sensitive data
- **System lockdown**: Disables all expansion functionality

## Configuration

TextShortcutter uses platform-specific secure storage:
- **Windows**: DPAPI (Data Protection API)
- **macOS**: Keychain Services
- **Linux**: libsecret (GNOME Keyring)

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bobersnip/TextShortcutter.git
cd TextShortcutter

# Install dependencies (Qt5, OpenSSL)
# On Ubuntu: sudo apt install qt5-default libssl-dev
# On macOS: brew install qt@5 openssl
# On Windows: Use vcpkg or download Qt installer

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Install
sudo make install
```

### Security Testing

The project includes comprehensive security testing:
- Input validation testing with malicious patterns
- Memory leak detection for sensitive data
- Encryption testing with various key strengths
- Performance impact analysis on system resources

## Security Reporting

For security concerns or vulnerability reports:
- **Email**: convenienceculturellc+security@gmail.com
- **Response Time**: 2-5 business days for security issues (varying based on schedule).

## Disclaimer

TextShortcutter is designed with security as a top priority, but no software can be completely secure. Users are responsible for:
- Setting appropriate security levels for their environment
- Regularly reviewing audit logs
- Using strong application filtering
- Following security best practices
